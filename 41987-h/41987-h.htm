<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<h3>VISION, THE NEED OF THE HOUR</h3>


<p>We are living in a day when it would almost seem
that the person who does not value vision is neither
helpful nor wise. For it is a day when the people
everywhere need an essential vision in order that
they may gain courage to settle down to constructive
effort after the close of the world war.</p>

<p>In other words there are multitudes who feel that
there is a far deeper significance to the opening of the
Panama Canal as commemorated by the Panama-Pacific
International Exposition than what appears
on the surface. There never was an Exposition like
it. There never will be another <a id="similar"></a>similar to it in the
future. Simply because there seems to be something
written between the lines. It is an Exposition in
which it appears to be natural for the sanest men to be
prophetic&mdash;one in which men not only behold the
star of faith but also feel that the star is calling them
to move toward something better, even if they have
to grope their way. An obscure vision seems to be
in the sky of hosts of people and they are anxious to
hear the interpretations of men who are brave enough
to suggest one. They are asking what does the peculiar
inspiration of this Exposition mean?</p>

<p>This book in which the commemorative chapters
are written in rhythmic prose&mdash;for which the author
need make no apology, in as much as Whitman and
others have already blazed the way for independence
of poetical expression&mdash;is given to the public
with the sole object in view of conveying a message
that has impressed the mind of the author.
For among the many kind expressions of commendation
on the prose-poem, "The United Seas," none has
been more appreciated than that given by David Starr
Jordan in these words, "Your prose-poem has a strong
message and many striking lines. I shall be glad to
see it published."</p>

<p>Josiah Strong in one of his most recent books entitled,
"The New World Life," says: "Socrates in the
Phoedo compares the people of his day, to whom the
lands about the Aegean were the whole world, to ants
and frogs about a marshy pond. Where would one
find a more fitting comparison for people of the same
sort in our day? The development of a world life bids
us pry out our horizon and learn to think in world
terms. Facts are God's alphabet from which we may
decipher tendencies and <a id="tendencies"></a>tendencies are prophetic."</p>

<p>And this prying out of the horizon from the nation
to the world&mdash;as the viewpoint of the sons of the pilgrims
has been widened from a New England to a continental
scope&mdash;is one of the highest responsibilities
and duties of our day. Please remember then that
the object of this book is to help others glimpse the
vision. You may say that there is no practical power
in vision. But we have been following the lure of the
Golden Age and the Holy City for centuries. Visions
are the only powerful things in life. And this is what
the people everywhere need now; not only practical
instruction but also a vision of something
grander and better than what they now have, in every
land; so that they will be inspired to action. I repeat
it: The most necessary thing for America, the waring
and neutral nations of the hour is a powerful vision of
what ought to be and what can be. Men ought to
arise in every country and give the people the vision.</p>

<p>So go forward, O book, not for the sake of displaying
any merit of words. But because you are winged
by the mighty inspiration of the hour. Speed on and
in some slight way help our international statesmen
and advocates of peace to carry their message to the
peoples from the nations about the seas.</p>

<h3><a id="FLOWERS_ON_ALL_SHORES"></a>FLOWERS ON ALL SHORES</h3>

<p>Not long after the opening of the Panama-Pacific
International Exposition, Blossom Day, an annual
feature in California life was observed, to be followed
later by nature's offering of flowers on the shores of
all nations. Here are some blossoms:</p>

<h3><a id="THE_WORDS_OF_AN_EASTERN_SAGE"></a>THE WORDS OF AN EASTERN SAGE</h3>

<p>Charles Francis Adams, whose grandfather was one
of our early Presidents and whose father was a Minister
to London before the Civil War, felt with overwhelming
reality the inspiration of the world vision.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams, a man of sound judgment and of importance
and distinction, a month before his recent
death, in writing about the European War, made the
following sage remarks:</p>

<p>"We suddenly find ourselves thrown back an entire
century. Again we are confronted by 'paper and
blockades' on an almost unprecedented scale, and by
'Milan' and 'Berlin' decrees, with 'orders in council, in
reserve and in response thereto.</p>

<p>"Such a situation has got to work itself out; and, in
my belief, can do so only through the complete exhaustion
of those more immediately engaged. When
that condition of exhaustion is fully developed the
neutral powers, if in the interim they have held themselves
in reserve, will be in a position effectively to
intervene. The whole sea usage of nations, commonly
known as 'international law,' will then have to undergo
a process of fundamental revision. The basic
principles only will be left; and a new system, which
will include in my belief a world federation, an organized
judicial tribunal and an international police must
be evolved.</p>

<p>"This is a large contract; and yet the task is one to
which both legislators and publicists cannot, I think,
too soon or too seriously address themselves. A great
educational process is involved, and cannot be prematurely
entered upon; but the time and mode of action
and concrete outcome are as yet hardly foreshadowed.
Under the condition, therefore, which I
have thus sought to outline, it seems to me that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
present is a time when those who think and feel as I
do should possess their souls with patience."</p>

<p>These are strong words. And although the time has
not yet come when the definite line of action can even
be foreshadowed, the people must get his inspiration.
He believes that there will be a revision of international
law and as has been said that there will be a
world federation, a united states of the world to give
expression of its rulings through an international
court, with its decrees enforced by an international
police force. It is going to take the sagacity of
strong men to bring this stupendous achievement to
pass. But because thoughtful people are beginning
to think in this direction, this magnificent ideal is not
an impossibility. It is to be prayed for, expected and
worked for. And in every land the vision should now
be given to the people.</p>

<h3><a id="BRILLIANTS_FROM_THE_TOWER_OF_JEWELS"></a>BRILLIANTS FROM THE TOWER OF JEWELS</h3>

<p>If God is light, Edison and his disciples must have
glimpsed some of His glory.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"They shall splash at a ten league canvas with
brushes of comet hair."&mdash;Kipling's words that might
be used in describing Jules Guerin's masterful work in
painting a thousand acre canvas.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"Fair city of the sun, laved by the blue seas, glowing
like a topaz within a setting of dark cradling
streets, that rose tier on tier around it."&mdash;Whitaker's
impression of the Exposition received upon entering
the Golden Gate from the sea.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The creamy surface of the tower of jewels is studded
with 125,000 great glass jewels made in Austria and
safely landed in this country, which with the floods of
light diffusing from concealed sources, creates an
illumination that is peculiarly impressive against the
background of the night's sky and often makes the
Exposition grounds lighter by day than by night.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>If Whitman was right when he said "dazzling and
tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me, if I
could not now and always send sunrise out of me," then
we do not exaggerate in saying that the sunlight
has partly spoken through the builders of the Jewel
City.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_VOICES_OF_TWO_CITIES"></a>THE VOICES OF TWO CITIES</h3>

<p>Two cities on the Western coast are heralding to
the world the triumphant completion of the Panama
canal. And if a certain writer is right in saying that
there are seven wonders of the modern world&mdash;telephone,
wireless, aeroplane, radium, and antisceptics
and antitoxins, spectrum analysis and X-rays&mdash;as there
were seven wonders of the ancient world, we can well
add that the Panama canal is the eighth modern wonder
and that it is the wonder of all wonders, ancient
and modern.</p>

<p>And it is well that nearly a year is to be given by
both cities to the commemoration of this event in order
that the whole world may fully feel the significance
of this remarkable engineering feat to its whole life.</p>

<p>The Panama-Pacific International Exposition held
at San Francisco, from February 20 to December 4,
1915, is the national celebration authorized and sanctioned
and partly financed by the government of the
United States, the total investment being $50,000,000.
The Exposition area covers 635 acres of ground, having
a frontage of two miles on the bay immediately inside
of the Golden Gate. The grounds are divided
into three main divisions; the foreign section nearest
to the Golden Gate, the central portion with its exhibit
palaces and great Tower of Jewels rising 435 feet
high and the eastern section for rest and amusement.
In keeping with the world consciousness four courts
are found on the grounds; the Court of the Four
Seasons; Court of the Universe; Court of Abundance;
Court of Palms; Court of Flowers. Every
state and territory in the Union has made exhibits
and in spite of the world war more than forty foreign
countries are represented and co-operating in the commemoration
of this most historic event.</p>

<p>The Panama-California Exposition is held at San
Diego, California, throughout the year 1915, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the sum of $3,500,000 was raised. The grounds are
embraced within a fourteen-acre park, known as "Balboa
Park," being at the very heart of the city of San
Diego. The Exposition is international in its scope
and has exhibits from all the American countries and
from some of the European and oriental nations. It
has an exhibit showing the progress of man from
primitive times up to the present; and also some beautiful
floral and horticultural exhibits, which are making
both of the expositions most attractive, many of
the tourists going south from San Francisco in order
that they may participate in both celebrations.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_THRESHOLD_OF_VISION"></a>THE THRESHOLD OF VISION</h3>

<p>The following prose-poem is written from the viewpoint
of the national spirit, pressing toward the
world vision which directly controls the thought of
the previous prose-poem. For the Golden Gate, especially
during the Exposition is for the quickened soul
the portal&mdash;the pulling aside of the curtain through
which one gets the world vision. The title, "Our
Pacific Sea" might well be interpreted:</p>

<p>Our&mdash;Democracy.</p>

<p>Pacific&mdash;Nationality.</p>

<p>Sea&mdash;Verging into the world-vision.</p>

<p>Here on this shore&mdash;as prophets are, of course,
doing elsewhere&mdash;we are putting our feet on the rock
and looking out over the waters and into the skys.
With San Diego, which is even nearer to the canal,
our whole coast is peculiarly susceptible to world
thought at this time. And the people who come here
may forever after have an outward and upward look
in their lives.</p>

<p>Much has been written concerning the flowers, hills
and climate of California, but at this time, when the
world is looking toward our coast, would that more
writers would reveal the thoughts that have been inspired
in their minds by the sight of our great Western
sea.</p>

<p>The prose-poem itself is a denial of the thought
that the Pacific is a monotonous calm&mdash;an appreciation
both of its storms and serenity written after several
visits to the beach in which both moods were displayed.
The first three verses, the prelude, describe the
impression made by the movement of the boisterous
sea landward, upon the observor when first arriving
at the shore.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_FIRST_TRIP_THROUGH_THE_CANAL"></a>THE FIRST TRIP THROUGH THE CANAL</h3>

<p>On August 18, 1914, the steamship Ancon made the
first regular, continuous trip, with a complete cargo,
through the canal, the steamer Cristobel making an
experimental journey a few days previously.</p>

<p>The Ancon, with Colonel Goethals on the bridge,
left Colon on scheduled time, passed through the locks
and within ten hours entered the waters of the Pacific
at Panama. And twenty-four hours after a
small fleet of ships of commerce made the passage
of the canal, the opening of which the world is now
celebrating on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>The commendable spirit displayed by America
in the opening of the canal is an indication of what
may be expected in the future as far as the United
States is concerned in perfecting equitable plans for
international co-operation.</p>

<p>The New York World puts it clearly in these
words: "Today the canal lies open to all the nations
of the world upon equal terms. The United States
has acted with entire good faith, and in the observance
of its treaties discriminated against none and reserved
no exclusive rights to itself. Beyond the collection
of tolls, which are uniform to ships of all flags, it
has assumed none of the privileges of national ownership
at the expense of friends and rivals in trade.
It has achieved a moral triumph no less impressive
than the material victory won by its engineers over
nature in the piercing of the isthmus."</p>

<h3><a id="THE_ALTRUISM_OF_COL_GOETHALS"></a>THE ALTRUISM OF COL. GOETHALS</h3>

<p>There is no more beautiful example in history of
international altruism than that displayed by Col.
G. W. Goethals, who will for all time be remembered
as the one who successfully completed the Panama
Canal. And if all men were like him in spirit the
brotherhood of the nations would begin tomorrow.</p>

<p>For when the National Geographic Society honored
Col. Goethals with the presentation of a medal, at its
ninth annual banquet held at Washington, D.C.,
which was attended by the president of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
States, his cabinet and the diplomatic representatives
of every great foreign nation, these are the words&mdash;entirely
free from American provincialism&mdash;that the
eminent engineer used in responding to the presentation
of the medal by President Woodrow Wilson:</p>

<p>"Mr. President, it is an easier task to build the Panama
Canal than it is for me to find words to express
appreciation of the honor conferred upon me by the
National Geographic Society and the distinguished
manner in which the presentation of the medal has
been made. This medal represents the satisfaction
of the National Geographic Society at the practical
completion of the canal and its approval of the services
rendered.</p>

<p>"Those services are not only individual services but
national services. The French were the pioneers in
the undertaking. But for the work that they did on
the isthmus we could not today regard the canal as
practically completed. But for the English we probably
would not have known the means of eradicating
malaria; the death rate would have been great. Among
individuals we have national representatives in the
Spanish and the English in our laboring force.</p>

<p>"The canal has been the work of many, and it has
been the pride of Americans who have visited the
canal to find the spirit which animated the
forces. * * * And so in accepting the medal and
thanking the National Geographic Society for it, I
accept it and thank them in the name of every member
of the canal army."</p>

<p>Goethals is truly a world citizen. And The National
Geographic Magazine well defines his spirit in
these terse words describing the completion of the
canal:</p>

<p>"Atlantic&mdash;Goethals&mdash;Pacific."</p>

<a id="THE_OLIVE_BRANCH_AS_AN_EMBLEM"></a>THE OLIVE BRANCH AS AN EMBLEM
OF WORLD PEACE</h3>

<p>In history the olive has been nobly emblematic of
three virtues&mdash;peace, purity and industry with its attendant
prosperity. And I mention these three virtues
for which the olive stands because we will never
in the world establish peace unless it is preceded in
community, state and nation by virile-mindedness,
which is the very secret of industry and prosperity
wherever they are found.</p>

<p>Whenever the Greek looked out at a foothill
mantled with an olive orchard, gently waving in the
distance, a sea of bluish-green leaves; or seized upon
an olive branch, he was reminded of the fact that no
man was worthy of a crown of olives <a id="unless"></a>unless he was
right-minded, peace-loving, and industrious. For, the
placing of a crown of olive twigs on the brow of a
person was the highest distinction that could be bestowed
on a citizen who had merited well of his country.</p>

<p>Not only were the noble-minded statesmen and
poets thus honored, but also the athletes who, by
scrupulous care and development of the body, gained
physical victories at the Olympic games. The harmless
and commendable victories of peace always result
from well-developed manhood. And so on the
last day of these games the victor received, in front
of the temple, the crown of wild olives gathered from
the sacred tree. For the olive was sacred to Minerva,
the goddess of wisdom and therefore of purity, peace
and prosperity.</p>

<p>Among the Romans also it had a similar significance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
The olive crown of the Roman conqueror at
an ovation and those of the equites at the imperial
review, alike typified the gifts of peace that, in a barbaric
age, could be secured by victory only. I say all
history has associated the olive with these three superb
virtues, wherever the olive tree has grown. But
if secular history has offered the olive branch to the
conqueror in honor of a peace secured through contest
or war, the surprising thing about the olive in
Biblical history is that it represents peace as coming
directly to an individual, community, or nation because
of a Christian-mindedness&mdash;a type of mind that
is controlled by reason, justice, love, intelligence, and
purity of thought.</p>

<p>For, what do these striking verses in the Prophet
Zechariah mean?&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What sees't thou? And I said, I have looked, and
behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the
top of it and his seven lamps thereon.</p>

<p>"'And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side
of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereon'."</p>

<p>What do these beautiful verses mean? Simply
this,&mdash;that the source of all peace, individual and international,
is that type of mind which Christ and
Christian statesmen have. The two olive trees, one
on each side of the candlestick, stand for Christian
character&mdash;one for the stern moral character of the
prophet, the other for the mercy of the true religious
teacher. And the candlestick stands for work, for
service for mankind and the nations. And as both of
the olive trees supply the light with oil, so we are not
to seek for peace on earth with the sword, but by increasing
the number of men whose service for humanity
is controlled by Christian morality and justice,
mercy, and kindness.</p>

<p>These are the men who will bring peace. God
increase the number! These are the men that provi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>dence
can use to correlate the nations into essential
democracy. These are the men who are
worthy of a crown of olives! These are the men that
we must depend upon to correct the compass of the
ship of the world, as it moves forward against the
besetting fury of antagonistic waters, bearing its
prow day by day and year by year against the unwearied
enmity of hateful waves, until it reaches the
haven of essential international peace.</p>

<h3><a id="ESSENTIAL_DEMOCRACY"></a>ESSENTIAL DEMOCRACY</h3>

<p>It may be helpful to relate, in just a word, what is
meant in this volume by essential democracy, essential
united earth and similar expressions. Springing from
the Christian idea that all men are created equal in
the sight of God, in opportunity, it stands for that type
of society in which the essential power of government
is wielded by the mass of the people.</p>

<p>The one thing that it is important to remember is
that a monarchy or an oligarchy is not necessarily an
antithesis of democracy&mdash;only absolutism in the form
of a monarchy or oligarchy or plutocracy is an antithesis
to democratic principles.</p>

<p>Many governments which live under the standard
of a republic are not democratic in spirit at all. Mexico
has virtually been a despotism. The Spanish-American
states, especially until recent years, were nothing
but a specie of military tyranny. And France
has often been only a bureaucracy in structure and in
state.</p>

<p>By essential democracy we mean the gradual
triumph of the principles which emphasize the equality
of man before God, and which are everywhere coming
into increasing recognition throughout the world.</p>

<p>One author says that before the middle of the nineteenth
century all the great European states, with the
exception of Russia and Turkey, had adopted a constitution
limiting the power of the crown "and investing
a considerable share of political power in the people,
and in most of them a representative legislature
of the parliamentary or British type was adopted."
While in Switzerland, Norway and Sweden alone on
the continent democracy has reached a type of true
efficiency. And these triumphs must be remembered
by the people for the sake of future inspiration and
courage; and because it may help one to interpret the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
present European war as an agony incident to the
progress of growth.</p>

<p>It is true that the victory of the principle of democracy
has been checked by the persisting of the military
spirit in Europe and the wonderful industrial
expansion in both Europe and America. In England
also the triumph "has been delayed by the prevalence
of aristocratic traditions which still grant privileges
and rights to a social class based on berth and inherited
wealth." While in American the simplicity of
the colonial life and the absence of the people from
the aristocratic classes of Europe promoted a vigorous
and commanding growth of the democratic ideas. And
this is why the nations of the world in their struggle
for democracy are looking to America, because she
has the most nearly of all nations realized the democratic
ideal.</p>

<p>In light of what has already been accomplished,
how inspiring then becomes the lure of the ideal of
world democracy. Essentially it is splendidly possible.
The people crave it because it is God-born. They
love to think and work and vote for that far-off divine
event. And more than that the words, monarchy
and oligarchy, are so out of date that they are anxious
to be in spirit and letter citizens of a republic. And
wherever the leaven is working thrones are in danger,
because great things are going to happen on this
God-guided globe, in the interest of humanity.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that there are fifty recognized
governments in the world; and that of this number
twenty-six are republics, twenty limited monarchies,
with democratic features, and only four absolute monarchies.
The very thought of this is an inspiration and
shows that all the nations are rapidly moving in the
direction of essential world democracy.</p>

<p>At the Congress of Religions held at the World's
Fair at Chicago in 1893, when the question came up as
to what would be an appropriate devotional appeal to
be used in opening the Congress, the representatives
of every religion and faith of the world unanimously
agreed that the Lord's Prayer found in the Sermon on
the Mount would be acceptable to all. And the one
given above is an adaption from the Lord's Prayer,
given in order that it may be seen how well its spirit
could be adapted to world democracy.</p>

<a id="PRECEPTS_FOR_WORLD_CITIZENS"></a>PRECEPTS FOR WORLD CITIZENS</h3>

<div class='hanging'>

<p>Never allow the glory of the world vision to keep you
from performing your daily duty, be it humble
or great; remembering that you are a part of
the whole and that the fullness of the <a id="worlds"></a>world's
life will not be expressed if one member of the
body fails to perform its function. Remember
that vision is worthless unless it helps you to
take hold of the handle of service with a firm
grasp and a new enthusiasm; but also that it is
necessary to enter into the spirit of the world
vision a few moments at the dawn of each day.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Do not be deceived into looking upon national bigotry
as patriotism. For the interests of humanity
are always primary to the interests of the nation.
What is good for the whole world is
good for each continent and government.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Begin to urge a national individualism among established
nations which insists less on rights and
more on duties; which recognizes that the
greed for territory is the "original sin of the
nations." God divided the world into nations
so that they might help, not destroy each other;
and when they admit this they will begin to inaugurate
essential world democracy.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Cultivate the spirit of "give and take"; recognizing
that there is good to be absorbed from other
nations into the international life as well as from
your own.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>Do not labor for a world peace which is to depend on
"treaties, or skillful diplomacy or mutual fear
and equal preparedness for war;" but for one
which is based "on the common interests and
sympathies and on the mutual needs and services
of a world organism, in which each nation
is a member of a world body-politic."</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Urge a more mature development of an international
conscience; remembering that an ethical standard
can be established for the world as it was
evolved from the individual to the tribal and
then to the national standard of ethics.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Do not forget that a man of another race is not a
different kind of animal than yourself. For
one has well said: "The strangest thing to me
is that people who are so different are so much
alike."</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Encourage the spread of the new knowledge which
has given to us a clearer understanding of disease
and through eugenics a vital interest in
those racial qualities which shall improve future
generations, remembering that when the
bodies and minds of the races are at their best
they will be more open to reason and more cordial
to the spirit of harmony among the nations.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Do not be too much alarmed about the talk of foreign
labor, or interracial marriage. But take
up the torch of enlightenment and <a id="fulfill"></a>fulfill today's
duty, remembering that in due time the
co-operative council of the Occidental and
Oriental mind will see that all problems are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>justly solved according to the best interests of
the whole race.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Insist that as soon as possible there be inaugurated a
permanent international court at the Hague,
which shall be endowed with the power to act
as well as discuss, in behalf of the interests of
the whole world.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Finally, put on the whole armor of a faith in a deity
which is not tribal nor national but the God of
humanity, that you may be able to defeat
prejudice. Stand, therefore, having your manhood
girt about with a broad intelligence; having
on the breastplate of righteousness wrought
from the essential morality of the races. Having
your feet shod with the gospel of world
peace, your judgment made discreet with the
gospel of contact and your soul made heroic
for service by an invincible faith in a better
humanity, such as was possessed by the Son
of Man.</p></div>

<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit. For in leaving the
prejudice of restricted nationalism they will
gain the inspiration of the world view and possess
more of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are the meek, those possessing the childlike
but world view point of Christ, for they shall
inherit the environment of the earth.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.
For the ethics of true religion is to
be sifted from the chaff of superstition, and
righteousness is to cover the whole earth as
the waters cover the seas.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are the merciful nations. For they shall obtain
mercy in return from other nations, and
learn that impulsive retaliation is too costly
and that patient and honorable conciliation
makes for world peace and national prosperity.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are the peacemakers. For now that the nations
have entered through the united seas into
a neighborhood; they&mdash;by encouraging disarmament
and teaching the gospel of contact as
well as good will&mdash;will hasten the day when the
nations can live together without war in the
spirit of council and peace.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>Blessed is he who is persecuted by people whose
minds are filled with race prejudice, national
pride and selfishness; for he has discovered the
secret of seeing good in all nationalities, of detecting
the soul behind the color, and shall be
honored by humanity as a pioneer of international
brotherhood.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and
persecute you and say all manner of evil against
you falsely, for so persecuted they Him who
said "Go ye into all the world and preach the
gospel to every creature." Rejoice and be exceeding
glad for great is your reward in heaven
and in the councils of the world.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are the pure in heart. For they shall see
God as transcendant and immanent in the
resurrected Christ. They shall find His spirit in
all life and behold His glory wherever they
journey throughout the wide world.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed is this noble brotherhood of manly souls. For
ye are not only the salt of the school, the city,
the state and nation; but also of the earth.
Yours is not the light of bigoted patriotism. But
ye are the light of the world. And your city
placed upon a hill cannot be hid.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Blessed are these pathfinders who do not fear the
seas, for they have discovered that the very
waters are resolutely moving toward freedom;
and they are being led forward by a pillar of
light into the promised land of the essentially
unified races.</p></div>

<h3><a id="THE_WORLDS_NEIGHBORHOOD"></a>THE WORLD'S NEIGHBORHOOD</h3>

<div class='hanging'>

<p>Remember that a new world neighborhood has been
created, bringing important points on the globe
into closer proximity by one-half to two-thirds
of the former distance, through the short route
of the Panama Canal.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Therefore, a new commandment is given to each
nation, namely, "to love thy neighbor as thyself,"
by entering by thought and co-operation
into such policies as will make for the best interest
of the entire new world neighborhood.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Do not think that other nations are unapproachable.
But remember that North and South America,
with all Europe, "are more closely related in
point of time and common interests than were
the original Thirteen States when the necessities
of commerce forced them to form the compact
of the Union; that the two geographical
extremes of the colonies were as far separated
as Berlin and the Barbary States or as London
and the Black Sea."</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Do not think that the short route through the canal is
merely a path for commerce's ships, or only a
highway for navies or state dignitaries; but remember
also that it is a short route to the
Hague and international congresses.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>And do not fail to recall that brave men opened
up this international highway&mdash;not through forests
or smoking prairies, but through mountains,
swamps, rocks and hills&mdash;in order to
hasten the day of essential world democracy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>So think clearly enough and you will surely see that
the completion of the Panama Canal is virtually
the discovery of a basis of essential world
unity. He who walks by land or sails by sea
can now read the will of God.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>With increasing numbers we are now arriving at the
day that Whitman speaks of in the following
words:</p>


<div class='poem'>
  <div class='stanza'>
   <span class="i-2">"The main shapes arise!<br /></span>
   <span class="i-2">Shapes of democracy total, result of centuries<br /></span>
   <span class="i-2">Shapes ever projecting other shapes,<br /></span>
   <span class="i-2">Shapes of turbulent manly cities,<br /></span>
   <span class="i-2">Shapes of the friends and home-givers of the whole earth,<br /></span>
   <span class="i-2">Shapes bracing the earth and braced by the whole earth."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The key that is in tune with all other keys of its own
instrument is in tune with all harmony on the
earth. And the man that has attuned his life
to justice and liberty in the community in which
he lives is in accord with freemen in every
land, loves the vision of world-wide liberty and
prays for its realization.</p>

<p class='center'>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Tagore, the Hindu poet, says: "I have learned though
our tongues are different and our habits dissimilar,
at the bottom our hearts are one. The
monsoon clouds, generated on the banks of the
Nile, fertilize the far distant shores of the
Ganges; ideas may have to cross from east to
western shores to find a welcome in men's
hearts. East is east and west is west&mdash;God forbid
that it should be otherwise&mdash;but the twain
must meet in amity, peace and mutual understanding;
and their meeting will be all the more
fruitful because of their differences; it must
lead to holy wedlock before the common altar
of humanity."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="WHAT_ARE_THE_SEAS_ABOUT"></a>WHAT ARE THE SEAS ABOUT?</h3>

<p>The deeper one goes into the subject of world democracy
the more one is convinced of the necessity of
calling to one's aid the help of true religion in formulating
a world consciousness.</p>

<p>Walt Whitman, whom many may regard as somewhat
unwise in some of his utterances, was absolutely
right when he intimated that world democracy could
not be formulated without religion.</p>

<p>And today there is nothing that is going to help
people so effectively to grasp and feel at home
with the ideal of an essential union of the nations, as
the modern teaching of the immanence of God. If we
are a part of the whole world, and if God is in the
seas as well as the flowers and hills then we will not
dread them, for they are our inspiration and helpers.</p>

<p>Not only does the teaching of the immanence of God
in the seas help the nations into closer fellowship.
But what is more than that, it helps the soul of man
to find in the waters a purpose. The seas themselves
seem to be up to something.</p>

<p>No man felt this secret of nature with keener appreciation
than the late Prof. J. J. Blaisdell of Beloit
College, Wis. For in one of his lectures, the notes of
which, I still have, he says:</p>

<p>"Nature is expressive of a purpose. And no one
has gotten the good of nature until he has got the
momentum of the mighty work that it is working.
Its face is steadily set forward. It is not static. It
is not a current running down. It is an achievement.
When you stop and think of it you are led to reflect
that its onward movement is so stupendous toward
the working out of a far off divine event that if you
should throw yourself across its track you would be
annihilated in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have stood on the shore of Lake Michigan on a
stormy day in December and the rhythm of that
lake seemed to be the echo of the march of the universe
treading its victorious way into the future. It
is about something&mdash;its face is steadfastly set to go
to Jerusalem. The firmness of great souls is but its
child and copy; and responded to, it is the breeder of
great souls.</p>

<p>"Now until we become alive to the expressiveness of
purpose in nature, a purpose expressed in feeling and
ready to lackey man in his pilgrimage, we fail to understand
nature and lose much of the blessedness of
living in this world.</p>

<p>"And my simple question is, how comes about this
expressiveness? Why, simply there is a person who
is projecting himself through this embodiment and it
is the revelation of him, just as our friends' ways express
the person of the friend behind them."</p>

<p>How grand are those words! And how helpful to
men who desire the very co-operation of the seas in
fulfilling their plans in unifying the races! For if
Prof. Blaisdell was thus inspired with the thought of
the co-operation of the waters of Lake Michigan with
the historic purposes of man, what should the true
freeman feel as he looks out over the Pacific? I can
only tell you what I have felt in the words on the following
page:</p>

<h3><a id="HOW_TO_BECOME_A_WORLD_CITIZEN"></a>HOW TO BECOME A WORLD CITIZEN</h3>

<p>To become a good world citizen, it is not necessary
to distribute oneself by travel everywhere&mdash;although
travel is most valuable&mdash;any more than it is absolutely
necessary for a worthy citizen of the United States
to cross the continent or have homes in both California
and New York, desirable as that may be.</p>

<p>Nor would one lose any interest in his nation&mdash;remembering
that only a bigoted and selfish nationality
does harm; and that even in a federation of the nations
of the world each individual nation, like each individual
State in the Union, would have its own interests
and would have to do its part towards expressing
the life of the whole.</p>

<p>Of course with the realization of a federation of the
world in the future, there would be public world citizens
as well as private world citizens, just as there
are public and private citizens in every nation; and
the public world leaders should necessarily have a
higher training, a wider experience and a broader
travel than the private world citizen, judging from
the standpoint of leadership alone.</p>

<p>But independent of these things it should be remembered
that every man&mdash;private or public&mdash;can acquire
full world citizenship by learning to think in world
terms and developing the world consciousness which
makes you feel that you are a necessary part of all
that exists. And this can be done by developing an
unprejudiced love for humanity, by persistently opposing
war, by keeping in touch with world statesmen and
reading world literature, by acquiring a love for nature
and the seas which comes from a faith in God,
by helping to unify the world's languages and religions,
by advocating constantly a central world government
for the nations, by traveling when one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and by making it as easy for people to travel as possible,
by attending all public meetings that deal with
international movements, by never losing sight&mdash;especially
in the hour of perplexity, <a id="ridicule"></a>ridicule and hardship&mdash;of
the world vision which is championed on
these pages and by becoming sanely religious so that
you will feel that the same good spirit throbs in your
breast that quickens the whole universe into harmony
and beauty as well as every flower and living thing on
the globe.</p>

<p>Here are some of the exceptional world citizens.
Hear them talk in their own words:</p>

<p>Whitman:</p>

<div class='poem'>
  <div class='stanza'>
   <span class="i0">"There is no trade nor employment but the young man following it may become a hero,<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe,<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">And I say to any man or woman, let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes."<br /></span>

human history, the work of essentially unifying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
globe. And as they go forward with this stupendous
task, they will not forget to pluck the flowers by the
wayside, look into the faces of children and take the
hand of their fellows; but rather they will do it with
a grander simplicity and a better humanity.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_KEY_TO_THE_VISION"></a>THE KEY TO THE VISION</h3>

<p>The very last and most important thing that must
be said on the subject of world consciousness is that
man himself is the key to the vision&mdash;is that man is
the fullest expression of God and that man can conquer
nature and build nations, republics and a world
democracy. The immanence of God in man is the secret
of sanity and balance in the study of this question
and also the power that is going to make the
vision a reality.</p>

<p>And I have purposely refrained from saying anything
about the superb position that man holds in this
mighty work in order that you might feel the grandeur
of the world vision through the power of the seas;
might feel the awful majesty of the vision, its divine
glory&mdash;in order that people might be arrested and
caught up in its mighty enthusiasm&mdash;before discovering
that the secret of bringing it to pass is the wholesome
secret of a simple human life. O wonder of
wonders, the simple key that balances our thought
and puts our feet on the earth in this hour of tremendous
vision is in man himself; is right here in our
own lives&mdash;is in the engineer, the educator, the missionary,
the preacher, the financier, all of whom can
rise superior to nature and gain dominion over the
earth. Let me express what I mean in the following
on "Balboa" who is so intimately associated historically
with the Panama canal and with the Pacific ocean,
as its discoverer:</p>

<h3><a id="A_NEW_INSPIRATION_FOR_LITERATURE"></a>A NEW INSPIRATION FOR LITERATURE</h3>

<p>A new inspiration for literature is at hand. The
times, with its mighty impetus for world movements,
more than ever demands a class of literature that has
at its heart the world consciousness. And the man
that is to write the literature, it seems to me, must
familiarize himself with three master-minds:</p>

<p>Walt Whitman, who chatted in terms of world
democracy and whose spirit was as readily attuned to
the earth as to the dew drop and flower.</p>

<p>Homer, the blind bard of Greece, the masterful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>terpreter
of the power of the oceans, who talked about
the seas as easily as the ordinary man converses about
village events.</p>

<p>Christ, the child-like but universal minded Leader
of the human race, who has quickened men to move
toward the essential unity of the races and nations.</p>

<p>Literature can now come to its own as never before.
Writers of fiction now have a new and superb opportunity
of introducing a majestic back ground to their
stories. Men everywhere feel the lure of a new inspiration.
They want to talk and write in grander terms,
bringing new glory to the simple and common place.
And they are sure to break forth in the song of a better
literature, orchestral with the spirit of world consciousness
and broadly sympathetic with the yearning for
essential world democracy. Commerce, science and religion
are active in world movements, and what a
mighty help it will be toward the realization of the
ideal when many writers of fiction and poetry, as well
as of history and politics, begin to take advantage of
this opportunity. I can think of no higher calling that
can engage the attention of man than that of trying to
express the inspiration of these days in a worthy literature;
which shall be majestically spiritual, and will
tell what the unscaled eyes see, microscoped and telescoped
to find the message of nature and history
thrilling with a divine life.</p>

<p>And when the masses who have not had the opportunity
to travel, catch the spirit of a world patriotism
and learn to think and talk in world terms&mdash;interested
not only in their city, their state, their nation, but also
in their world movements,&mdash;then a world government
unifying the nations will be more easily formulated. I
say, when the people once glimpse the vision of world
peace, world harmony (or democracy) in its full
grandeur, a spirit will be aroused that all the warring
kings and illegitimate trusts on earth cannot check!
David Starr Jordan well says in a most capable and
thorough series of articles on "How to End War" that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
"people under the stress of immediate excitement
might vote for war, especially if told of some vicious
aggression." How true that is! And we should also
add that there is a cure, a substitute for this false excitement.
For the excitement about war is only coarse
vaudeville in comparison with the noble passion that
takes hold of men's lives when they become interested
in the struggle and movements that make for world
harmony.</p>

<p>And to create this higher enthusiasm&mdash;which can
never be quenched when once it is kindled in a man's
heart&mdash;the constructive workers need the co-operation
and help of the deepest and clearest visioned men of
letters in every nation. The task of reconstruction
will be so stupendous that the orator, the press,
the writer, must be enlisted to bring the vision to the
people so that they and their rulers can be more readily
led by the constructive international statesman into
essential world democracy.</p>

<p>And it is the uniting of the two hemispheric seas
that so irresistibly suggests the essential union of the
nations. There never was an Exposition held, nor ever
will be, affording such a vision of world unity; not
only because of the union of these two oceans associated
with this event, but also because of the world
war, which cannot avoid being interpreted by some of
the most penetrating thinkers as the darkness before
the dawn. Any man of clear vision who stands with
Goethals at the mingling of the two hemispheric bodies
of water looking through the clouds of war cannot help
but speak prophetically. The world has been brought
together geographically. It will also be brought into
essential harmony politically and racially. The new
proximity of the nations created by the canal demands
it. And above all, it is the inevitable drift of things.
Blessed then are the people that have the vision! And
twice blessed are those who give it to others! And
above all, blessed are the men who are laboring to
make the vision a reality!</p>

<h3><a id="FROM_SEA_TO_TREE_AND_FRUIT"></a>FROM SEA TO TREE AND FRUIT</h3>

<p>The following two chapters were prepared for special
occasions commemorative of typical California
life. The one on "The Olive in Biblical History" was
written by the author in compliance to a request from
"The California Ripe Olive Day Association" to be
used in the observance of the first California Ripe
Olive Day, March 31st, 1915, at the Panama-Pacific
International Exposition.</p>

<p>The chapter on "The Modern Parable of the Orange
Tree" was delivered as a special address at Porterville,
California, just previous to the beginning of the
harvesting of the golden fruit in that section, and is
in keeping with "Orange Day" as observed at the Exposition.</p>

<p>And it is well for us to close the book with these
chapters for the world view only helps us to appreciate
the inland beauty more, and the valleys with
their restricted vision only prepare us in return for
the world enterprises again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="THE_OLIVE_IN_BIBLICAL_HISTORY"></a>THE OLIVE IN BIBLICAL HISTORY</h3>

<p>In the Old Testament times the olive was recognized
as the "fruit of fruits." But during the
hurry and rush of Western progress a gross oversight
has been committed, especially on the part of the
American people, in failing to fully appreciate its
value; and as a result the olive has not as yet gained
its true leadership here among the elect of the trees,
composed of the orange, pear, apple, pomegranate,
fig, and date.</p>

<p>But the oversight has been discovered by the pioneers
of the olive industry in America, and the signs
of the time indicate that the olive will be known here
as it was in the Holy Land. And, with the unprecedented
developments in the ripe olive industry, it has an
opportunity of becoming even more favorably known
than ever before.</p>

<p>By a careful study, recall the place that the olive held
in the old Promised Land and you will get a faint idea
of what we mean by the rediscovery of the olive in this
new Promised Land situated here on the coast of our
Western empire.</p>

<p>Where the olive originated, we do not know. Some
think in Syria. Others are not afraid to say that it
is as old as man himself. For not only did it grow
previous to the flood, as is indicated by the dove bringing
an olive leaf to the ark. But some actually maintain
that it was one of the trees that grew in the
Garden of Eden, wherever that may have been. And
whether such an assertion is far-fetched or not, there
is absolutely no reason why this wonderfully fruitful
tree should not have been one of the very first trees
appearing on the globe for the sustenance of human
life.</p>

<p>But wherever it came from, of this Bible students
are absolutely certain&mdash;that it was the most popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
tree in the Promised Land. Indeed, it seems to have
been one of the inducements that led the children of
Israel escaping from Egyptian captivity to move toward
Canaan, the Land of Promise with an irresistible
expectancy. For the Promised Land that they
were to enter is described&mdash;a description which would
most accurately apply to our own California&mdash;vividly
in the Bible as follows:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"For the Lord thy God bringeth them into a
good land, a land of brooks and water, of fountains
and depths that spring out of valleys and
hills. A land of vines and fig trees and pomegranates,
of olive and honey."</p></div>

<p>And not only were these freemen from Egypt encouraged
by the fact that they would find the olive
with other trees flourishing in the Promised Land;
but they were also commanded, according to the
author of Deuteronomy, to recognize its superior importance
and cultivate it everywhere, in these clearly
put words: "Thou shalt have olive trees through all
thy coasts." And today the very names of different
localities in Palestine, such as the Mount of Olives
and Gethsemane&mdash;that is, Gath-Semen, which means
the "oil press"&mdash;indicates the love of those people for
the beautiful olive groves, which gently nodded at
each other across roads and lanes when wooed by the
winds, even as they do in California, this newer Land
of Promise.</p>

<p>No one saw how conspicuously and romantically
the olive was associated with the early Bible history
of these people, as well as the prophet Jotham, who
spoke the famous fable of the olive&mdash;in which he unmistakably
infers that people should recognize it as
the most important of the fruits&mdash;in these striking
and beautiful words, found in the book of Judges:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"And Jotham went and stood on the top of
Mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice and said,
'Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king
over them and they said unto the olive tree,
"Reign over us" (or, as one of the versions so
suggestively translates the Hebrew, "Wave your
branches over us").'"</p></div>

<p>The olive also held a most conspicuous place in
the religious life of the peoples of the Promised Land.
Indeed, in the building of Solomon's temple 480 years
after the Babylonian captivity, the olive wood was
honored by being used in completing the most sacred
parts of the edifice. The cherubims, the sacred
symbols of Divine wisdom, one on each side of the
oracle and each with wings five feet long extending
over the temple walls, were made of the olive tree.</p>

<p>In fact, the book of First Kings shows that the olive
wood was built into most of the conspicuous parts of
the temple, in these definite words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"And for the entering of the oracle, be made
doors of the olive tree; the lintel and side posts
were a fifth part of the wall. So was also made
for the door of the temple posts of the olive tree, a
fourth part of the wall."</p></div>

<p>Not only was the olive given a primary place industrially
and religiously; but it was also pressed into
service on festive occasions of joy, commemorating
historic events. It was used at the great feast of the
Tabernacles, in constructing the booths, made principally
of olive branches, intermingled with branches
from other trees. And when spring hangs her infant
blossoms on California's thousands of olive trees, rocked
in the cradle of the western breeze, we will not
fail to understand why Nehemiah reminds us of the
early Jews' deep appreciation of the olive branch as a
symbol of joy, in these words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"So the people went forth and brought them
olive branches (with pine and myrtle) and made
themselves booths, every one upon the roof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>his house, and in their courts. And all the congregation
of them that were come again out of
the captivity made booths and sat under booths,
and there was very great gladness."</p></div>

<p>And the Psalmist himself must have been inspired
by the joy that came from the prosperity of these olive
groves, when he wrote, in the one hundred and twenty-eighth
Psalm:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands,
happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy children shall be like olive plants round about
thy table."</p></div>

<p>Indeed, with the Greeks and Romans, the Israelites
found that there was no tree that could be used for so
many purposes as the olive&mdash;its fruit for food, its
wood for costly decorations, its branches and blossoms
for festive occasions, and its oil for medicine
and light. For not only was the olive itself used, but
the oil was also used for the anointing of the bodies
of the sick, the captive and the dead. And the oil was
likewise valued for illuminating purposes in the lamps
and vessels in the tabernacle. And how highly they
regarded it, we can fully understand by reading these
words from Leviticus:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"Command the children of Israel that they
bring in to thee pure oil of olive beaten for the
light to cause the lamps to burn continually."</p></div>

<p>There was no spot in all of Palestine that Christ
loved to frequent more than the Mount of Olives, to
which he retired for meditation and rest. And why
was this? It may have been because of the general
outlook that he gained upon nature; which is doubtless
true in part. But it was not the primary nor exclusive
reason why He resorted to the Mount of
Olives. For if there are tongues in trees, as well as
sermons in stones, I <a id="thoroughly"></a>thoroughly believe that those beautiful
olive groves must have said something to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
observing mind. What was it? Why did He go to
the Mount of Olives?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because the olive is the symbol of
peace. As Ovid said, "In war the olive branch of
peace is in use." So the olive groves which the poet
Browning says "have the fittest foliage for dreams,"
may have helped Him in coming from the turmoil of
<a id="Jerusalem"></a>Jerusalem to regain calm and self-control for a warring
soul.</p>

<p>Or, as He walked <a id="through"></a>through the orchards, noticing that
each tree was sympathetic to the rest and that each
appeared to be a neighbor to the rest, He may have
been inspired by thoughts similar to those of the eloquent
naturalist who said, "The trees live but to love
and in all the groves the happy trees love each his
neighbor." And as a result He found it more possible
to return to His work with a quickened love for
His fellow-men.</p>

<p>Or perhaps suggestions for chivalrous meekness
came to Him as He observed the gray foliage of the
trees modestly glistening in the sunlight. It might
have helped Him to say, "Blessed are the meek."</p>

<p>It may have been that the inspiration of timeless
time, the power of eternal years, was awakened in
His thought by the knowledge of the marvelous age
of those trees. He may have known that well cared
for trees will live for three hundred years and even
longer. For so great is the olive's hold on life that
even when a dying tree is cut down close to the
ground, its vigorous root will give birth to still another
tree.</p>

<p>Or it may have been that the Mount of Olives,
clothed with green beauty, like many of our own olive-planted
foothills, helped Him more to find the spiritual
inspiration of nature than a trip to some other,
bald and naked, mountain; helped Him to say:</p>

<div class='poem'>
  <div class='stanza'>
   <span class="i0">"All are but parts of one stupendous whole<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Great in the earth as in the ethereal frame;<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"Glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>All these inferences may be true and doubtless are
in part. But&mdash;if I dare say it&mdash;it seems to me that the
primary lesson that Christ learned in frequenting the
Mount of Olives was the importance of fruitfulness
of life. For the predominant characteristic of the
olive is fruitfulness. So much so that Spencer in his
"Faerie Queen" speaks of the warlike birch&mdash;"the
beech for shafts," "the ash for nothing ill," "the
willow for forlorn paramours;" but always and every
time, he speaks of the olive as the "fruitful olive."</p>

<p>And this is the reason why the olive should wave
its branches over the other trees. For, like manna,
it is a composite growth&mdash;a food, a fruit, a medicine.
Always fruitful for a three-fold end; and never failing
to be prolific, the trees bearing even for centuries.</p>

<p>And this is why the prophet Jotham reports the
trees as first urging the olive to become king; and
why he felt disappointed when the olive tree, in the
beginning, refused, saying:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p>"Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me
they honor God and man, and go to be promoted
over the trees?"</p></div>

<p>For, according to the fable, the trees after consulting
the fig and vine were finally compelled to temporarily
enthrone the worthless bramble as king, even
as Israel had selected the most incompetent man for
ruler, instead of choosing the most efficient statesman
who was available.</p>

<p>But justice and good judgment would not long
tolerate the rule of a worthless potentate. So they
ultimately succeeded in enthroning a worthy king, in
throwing away the bramble and finally crowning the
olive to wave its branches modestly but worthily over
the other fruit-bearing trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="THE_MODERN_PARABLE_OF_THE_ORANGE_TREE"></a>THE MODERN PARABLE OF THE ORANGE TREE</h3>

<p>It is most appropriate at this season when California
is just beginning to harvest its "golden
crop" to open wide our eyes and find the message of
these beautiful fruit bearing trees. For the Christ,
who's mind was quick to pronounce a curse on idleness
in the parable of the barren fig tree, would no
doubt have been just as alert to have emphasized
worthy success by speaking a parable of the orange
tree, had there been orange groves in Palistine then
as there are today.</p>

<p>But there were no citrus trees in the Holy Land
when He walked its highways and crossed through
its orchards. Hence the religious worker of today
has the advantage over the founder of our faith of a
visual acquaintance with this luxuriant tree. Indeed
this fruit has, because of its color, become the most
attractive of all fruits in modern life, so universally
in demand that it seems to me that the orange itself
has and is still seeking interpreters. So if, with
Ruskin, we can only "open our eyes and see things"&mdash;see
through and back of things, I am sure that we will
clarify the vision of our souls and find emphasized
some abiding truths in a new parable of the orange
tree.</p>

<p>It would be informing to speak of the first orange
fruit found in America&mdash;to tell in detail how the
Spanish explorers gave the citrus fruit to the Indians
of Florida, who in eating it dropped the seeds in the
soil, making possible the wild orange groves now
beautifying the valley of the Indian river. For this
is the romantic story of the origin of the orange tree
in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Or it would be keenly interesting to every Californian
to read about the arrival of the Franciscans in
the southern part of our State, who established twenty
missions in the rear of each of which was a garden
where the orange, olive and fig were planted and bore
fruit. Because this explains the inception of the industry
in our great commonwealth and puts into our
hand the key which unlocks the entrance to these
modern gardens of Hesperides&mdash;these orange belts
now scattered throughout our State.</p>

<p>Or in this day when scholars are feverish to learn
the origin of things, we could speak of the world's
first orange trees which were found in India. From
the two original <a id="spices"></a>spices&mdash;the bitter and sweet&mdash;which
were first discovered there, we could trace the evolution
of the one hundred different varieties of the citrus
fruit which are found in the world today, the
original fruit being imported by merchants from India
into China in the ninth century and into Europe
in the fifteenth century, and then finding its way to
America during the period of Spanish exploration.</p>

<p>But we prefer to be interpretive, to come closer home
than this. We prefer to consider these fruit bearing
orchards as an object lesson immediately at hand
and to think of the labor and activity of the people
co-operating with nature's forces that have made this
golden crop about to be harvested possible. Thus
recognizing at once the suggestion coming so
eloquently from these trees that, the fundamental secret
of all growth in character as well as in nature is
adaption to environment and service, not the passive
submission of Calvinism alone, nor the uncontrollable
egotism of an unrestrained Arminianism, but the
union of both, the working of God with man&mdash;spiritual
co-operation, the most helpful phrase in modern
religious thought. So with this primary principle as a
premise let us try to interpret in detail the new parable
of the orange tree. For the man that has learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
its parable has found, as Dr. McClaren would say, the
secret of a fine soul culture.</p>

<p>Some days past as I stood upon an elevation commanding
a view of that great area of eight thousand
acres of orange groves, spreading off into the distance
with its wide expanse of tree tops blended into
a continuous luxuriant green and its myriads of ripening
oranges nestling in the deep green back ground,
like countless numbers of gold fish at the surface of a
sea or like circular stars in some new sky, these were
the three suggestions that came to me as I tried to
learn its beautiful parable.</p>

<p>First, the secret of a refined Christian character is
an abiding sense of the reality of God, as revealed in
Christ. For the finest spirits, the deepest minds and
the most arresting personalities from Gladstone and
Lincoln down to the ordinary citizen, have been those
that have drawn their inspiration and thought from
hidden sources. Just as the fruit and leaves of these
trees receive their rich color from the sunbeams and
absorb their health from the moisture coming from
the heart of God's hills, so the cultured souls of history
have received their winsome illumination of personality
from a light that shineth neither by land nor
sea.</p>

<p>We realize that these trees could not grow where
there is limited sunshine and a restricted water supply.
Neither can men find moral maturity and health
until they possess that type of mind which is characterized
by spiritual reality. We know that California's
far-famed orange orchards would not be possible
without incessant sunlight; and that our golden
fruit would never again pass through the Golden Gate
to the markets of the world, if the sun did not appear
to shower down upon our orchards its magic beauty
gathered in its own paradise beyond the gates of the
morning. But Tennyson, who had a sane knowledge
and appreciation of the Sun of Righteousness, was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
well aware of the secret of a beautiful life when he
said of those who had not discovered it,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
   <span class="i0">""For what are men better than sheep or goats<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"That nourish a blind life within the brain,<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"If, knowing God, they lift not bands of prayer<br /></span>
   <span class="i0">"Both for themselves and those who call them friend?"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>At first I could not understand why the owners
cultivated their orchards so incessantly. But when I
was told by one of the experts that continual pulverizing
of the soil made the moisture more accessible
to the roots, permitted the oxygen of the air to find its
way to the tree, and liberated the nitrogen in the soil
so that it would be absorbed, then I saw clearly that
there was a scientific reason for the constant harrowing;
and felt that it might be very practical to demand
that we deepen our convictions so that we can
go into the fields of human life equipped with the
mighty contagion of something to say that will go
deeper than the ears, to harrow the inner life of patronizing
listeners. For without the prophet whose
harrowing words opens up a way to the nerve of conscience
and quickens the deeper emotions of the soul
men will not become eager to receive truth and the
masses will remain proselytes of mammon and low
ideals. Indeed the irresistible characters in religious
service like the great singers are those who have had
their hearts broken; but at the same time and as a
result, their interest in righteousness deepened and
their wills nourished and strengthened.</p>

<p>These trees are peculiarly beautiful and strong because
they send their roots into a well prepared soil
thrilling with the liberated elements of life and their
branches into God's air to woo the purity of the sunlight.
And the young who are to lead us safely in
the future are those whose souls have been cultured
by helpful and trying experiences&mdash;those who have
been taught to think deeply, to see far in vision and
to act bravely because the conviction of truth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
experience has liberated from the subconscious mind&mdash;or
the subsoil of their lives&mdash;those elements which
send through the whole man the iron of the prophet
and the revealed wisdom of the apostle.</p>

<p>One of the strange characteristics about the orange
is that the tree is unusually sensitive and the fruit
very hardy. Indeed the tree can be blighted by a
frost that will not injure deciduous fruits so that it
must be planted in localities protected by a warm
climate and God's hills, and often watched and tended
like an infant child. But the orange itself, which is
so hardy, has an <a id="advantage"></a>advantage over many other varieties
of fruits and can be shipped into any market in the
world. For the citrus fruit is not perishable in the
same sense that the plums and peaches are and after
being removed from the trees may be kept for weeks
with advantage without being destroyed by decay or
losing its beauty.</p>

<p>I say this is rather unusual. But, to mention the second
lesson of the parable, it is no stranger than the
guiding of youth through the formative years into a
maturity, morally beautiful and capable of vision. And
it is only as the home and school, the church and
state watch over these sensitive periods, protecting
the young from the blights of the frosts of skepticism
and sensuality that their lives will mature into characters
as golden and hardy as our native fruit. Sane,
honorable evangelism never excludes Christian nurture
any more than the sunlight obviates the necessity
of soil cultivation.</p>

<p>The orange tree, it is true, does not tower in height
and conspicuous leadership like the giant Sequoias and
Redwoods&mdash;although it is said that the bitter specie
of the tree occasionally acquires considerable diameter
and that the trunk of one near Nice still standing in
1789 became so large that two men could scarcely
embrace it. The citrus tree does not tower like Babel.
But better yet, it simply bears fruit for food&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the giants of the forest fail to do&mdash;like the strong men
who prefer only to be reliably useful.</p>

<p>And this third thought suggested by our object lesson
is most apparent. For with the instinct of good
Americans we hasten to declare that the sight of
these trees all comparatively of the same height and
vibrant with the same beauty and glow of health
does not suggest a monarchy, an aristocracy or even
a plutocracy but rather a successful democracy; not
only one of an equality of rights, because they all
have access to the same sunlight and soil, but also an
equality of duty because they all seek to bear fruit&mdash;a
commonwealth in which every private citizen is capable
of being an uncrowned king. This must have
been the lesson that Ruskin interpreted from nature
when he said: "A forest of all manner of trees is poor,
if not disagreeable in effect, a mass of one species of
trees is sublime."</p>

<p>And thus as I stood on the highest foothill overlooking
these valleys, these were the most important
thoughts that were suggested to me by what I saw&mdash;the
necessity of these three qualities in the forming of
mature character, faith in God, the guidance and protection
of friendship and education for youth, and
useful service, all of which condensed into a single
phrase means the co-operation of God with man in
producing the beautiful fruit of a refined, symmetrical
life.</p>

<p>And then it dawned upon me that a number of other
men had also learned parables from the trees. For
as I looked over that great expanse of orchards to the
south, detecting the irrigating streams flowing among
the trees, with patches of the barren desert appearing
here and there in striking contrast, the results of an
abiding faith in God came to me in the words of
David:</p>

 <div class='quote'>
<p>"Blessed is the man that walked not in the counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>

<p>"He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of
water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season, his
leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper."</p></div>

<p>And finally as I descended the foothill and came
long side of an orchard and saw a barren, scrubby
trunk next to a splendid orange tree vigorous and
laden down with fruit, the words of Christ pressed to
my lips for utterance: "By their fruit ye shall know
them. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; A good tree cannot bear evil fruit,
neither can an evil tree bear good fruit."</p>

<p>It was then that I said to myself, why should not
all men observe and find the helpful parable in this
favorite California tree. Because we are more than
mere animals we should rebel against hearing the terrible
parable of a barren fig tree pronounced on
our lives. But if we profit by the thoughts suggested
by a modern parable of the orange tree, then our
spirit will be as beautiful and wholesome as the
eternal green of its leaves, our character as golden as
its fruit and our deeds as numerous as its blossoms,
for often the new blossoms appear before the ripe
fruit has been picked from the branches.</p>
